# Conv-TasNet
Tensorflow - keras implementation of Conv-TasNet,  Modify according to codeKaituo Xu
["TasNet: Surpassing Ideal Time-Frequency Masking for Speech Separation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454).

## Install
Tensorflow with eager_excution() (1.3.0~2.0.0),Py3,librosa, numpy, ect in import 

## Dataset
TIMIT dataset load method can be find in previous work, I will upload them as fast as possible
